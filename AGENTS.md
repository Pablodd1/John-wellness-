# AGENTS.md — Mandatory Agent Rules for BuildScan AI (CuasarX Longevity)

All AI agents working in this repository MUST read and apply these rules on every
task. The skills referenced below are installed in `.agents/skills/` and pinned in
`skills-lock.json`. They are not optional.

## Rule 1 — GitHub Open Code Review & Verification (always apply)

Source skills: `code-review`, `autofix` (coderabbitai/skills)

- **Pre-commit diff check:** review the full `git diff` before every commit. Never
  commit code you cannot explain line by line.
- **Zero secret exposure:** no API keys, tokens, connection strings, or passwords
  in code, commits, logs, or test fixtures. Secrets live only in Vercel/GitHub
  environment variables and secrets. If a secret appears in a diff, stop and
  rotate it before proceeding.
- **Security audits:** check new dependencies for advisories (`npm audit`), check
  new endpoints for auth/validation/rate-limiting appropriate to their risk, and
  check any HTML/JSX rendering of model or user output for injection.
- **Build gates:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and
  `npm run build` must all pass before a change is considered done. A change that
  is not verified is not finished.
- **Clean commits:** one logical change per commit, imperative subject line, body
  explaining root cause (not just symptoms). Never mix feature work with
  debugging debris, stray files, or unrelated-project changes.
- **Workspace hygiene:** this workspace intentionally contains unrelated project
  folders (ignored in `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`, excluded in
  `tsconfig.json`). Never commit them, never install their dependencies into
  this `package.json`.

## Rule 2 — Modern Web Quality & React Best Practices (always apply)

Source skills: `vercel-react-best-practices`, `vercel-composition-patterns`,
`vercel-optimize`, `web-design-guidelines` (vercel-labs/agent-skills) and
`seo`, `performance`, `accessibility`, `core-web-vitals`,
`web-quality-audit`, `best-practices` (addyosmani/web-quality-skills)

- **Waterfall elimination:** no sequential awaits for independent work — use
  `Promise.all`. No client-side fetch chains that could be a single server
  response. No waterfall of dependent effects when a derived value suffices.
- **Bundle optimization:** keep the client bundle lean; prefer server components
  and dynamic imports for heavy client-only code (camera, charts); tree-shake
  icon imports; measure before and after any "optimization."
- **Technical SEO:** every public page has a unique title and description;
  canonical URLs use trailing slashes consistently; `robots.txt` and sitemap stay
  in sync with real routes. (This app is currently `noindex` by design —
  keep it that way until it is ready for public indexing.)
- **WCAG 2.2 accessibility:** semantic HTML, labeled form controls, icon-only
  buttons carry `aria-label`, color is never the only signal, hit targets are
  at least 44px, and focus order is logical. New UI must be usable with
  keyboard and screen reader.
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1. Images get explicit
  dimensions; fonts don't cause layout shift; long tasks are broken up.

## Monitoring contract

- `scripts/jev-audit.mjs` audits key routes and classifies failures with Jev
  (System-1, `jev-latest`) — heuristics take over if `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is absent.
- `.github/workflows/jev-monitor.yml` runs it every 6 hours, on push to
  main/master, and on demand. Required secrets: `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`,
  `RESEND_API_KEY`, `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` (optional `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`),
  plus repo variable `BASE_URL`.
- When adding a route that defines availability, add it to `ROUTES` in
  `scripts/jev-audit.mjs`.

## Verification checklist (run before declaring any task done)

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors
2. `npm run lint` — zero errors/warnings
3. `npm test` — all pass
4. `npm run build` — succeeds
5. `git status` — only intended files staged; no foreign-project files
6. Live verification after deploy: `curl /api/health`, and for user-facing
   changes, one real request through the affected flow
